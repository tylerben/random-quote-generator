		quote : "The mountains are where I remember being with my friends. The timeline of any friendship is a series of scenes or memories, times where you were together over the course of the relationship. I’ve spent plenty of time with my friends drinking coffee and sharing dinner at restaurants; but those scenes always fade in to the background, overshadowed by adventures like this.",

		quote : "We use the word suffering way too much. Every adventure has both the light, the dark, the toil and the reward. To experience that alone is to become absorbed by an activity, by a place, and by its people.... You no longer know where you end and where the world begins. We become raw. This is why we take the trip. This is what we come for.",

		quote : "Over the last few years, however, as I’ve watched too many friends go to the mountains only to never return, I’ve realized something painful. It’s not just the memorable summits and crux moves that are fleeting. Friends and climbing partners are fleeting, too. This is the painful reality of our sport, and I’m unsure what to make of it. Climbing is either a beautiful gift or a curse.",
